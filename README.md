# Harpoon

Bookmark up to 10 Hyprland windows and jump to them from anywhere — an
[Omarchy](https://omarchy.org) plugin in the spirit of
[Harpoon](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/harpoon) for Neovim.

A jump floats, centers and pins the window on top of your **current**
workspace. Jump to the same slot again, or press `SUPER+W` on it, and it goes
back into its reserved tile, with focus returning to the window you were
working in. While a tiled window is away, a Harpoon logo holds its place;
click the placeholder to bring the window back. The reservation also keeps
an otherwise empty workspace alive.

## Requirements

- Omarchy 4.x (Quickshell shell, Lua Hyprland config)
- `grim` — optional, for the preview fallback

## Install

Replace `<repository-url>` with this repository’s GitHub URL:

```bash
omarchy plugin add <repository-url>
omarchy plugin enable harpoon
```

Alternatively, run `./install.sh` from a local checkout to install and enable
the plugin.

After either installation method, add this line to
`~/.config/hypr/bindings.lua`:

```lua
dofile(os.getenv("HOME") .. "/.config/omarchy/plugins/harpoon/hypr/harpoon-bindings.lua")
```

Reload Hyprland to activate the shortcuts:

```bash
hyprctl reload
```

To add a bar button showing the bookmark count and opening the list:

```bash
omarchy plugin enable harpoon right
```

## Keys

`SUPER+H` opens a one-shot group; the next key acts and the group closes.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `A` | Bookmark the focused window in the first empty slot |
| `1`–`9`, `0` | Jump to slot 1–10; jumping to a slot already on screen restores it |
| `Shift`+digit | Bookmark the focused window **at** that slot |
| `Space` | Focus the on-screen bookmark (cycling if several); otherwise open the list |
| `Escape` | Cancel |

`SUPER+W` restores an on-screen bookmark instead of closing it; any other
window closes as usual.

### The list (`SUPER+H`, `Space`)

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `↑`/`↓`, `j`/`k` | Move |
| `Shift+↑`/`↓` | Swap with the neighbouring bookmark |
| `Shift`+digit | Move the selection to that slot (swapping if taken) |
| `r` | Rename |
| `d` / `Shift+D` | Delete / clear all — restores borrowed windows first; never closes them |
| `p` | Preview: Live → Thumbnail → Off (remembered) |
| `Enter`/`Space`, click | Jump |
| `q`/`Escape` | Close |

Windows behind the list stay interactive, so you can pick another window
and bookmark it without closing the list — which is why there's no
click-outside-to-close.

Closing a bookmarked window automatically removes it from the list and frees
its slot. The remaining bookmarks keep their slot numbers. Stale bookmarks
from previous sessions are also removed when the plugin loads.

Preview modes are Live, Thumbnail, and Off. Thumbnail captures a still image
when the list opens; your chosen mode is remembered.
